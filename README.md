**Reminder:**
This a just a prototype. Hence, ensure stock ticker and other inputs are valid, as exception and error handling are both not very comprehensive.
Also this app uses Yahoo Finance API. Hence, certain stocks in the APAC including Japan region will have missing financial information.
US stocks have minimal issues with mising data.
